To run our application ensure that you are in the ‘./webpage’ directory of our application directory first. Afterwards, you may access our application by running a local server there like so:

python -m http.server

By default the application will run on ‘localhost:8000’ if you have no other applications running on the same port. Note that you may use other local web development tools to run our application if you prefer.
