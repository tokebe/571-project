# COMPSCI 571 - Final Project

A dashboard with UFO and Airport D3.js visualizations from the [National UFO Reporting Center Online Database](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html) and the [OpenFlights Airport](https://openflights.org/data.html#airport) dataset.

## Running the Application

To run our application ensure that you are in the `./webpage` directory of our application directory first. Afterwards, you may access our application by running a local server there like so:

``` bash
python -m http.server
```

By default the application will run on `localhost:8000` if you have no other applications running on the same port. Note that you may use other local web development tools to run our application if you prefer.
